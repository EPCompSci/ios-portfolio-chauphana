### Tom's Tic Tac Toe
[Repository](https://github.com/chauphana/Tom-s-Tic-Tac-Toe)

This was my first iOS project I played around with. The goal was to just mess around and see how I can program a computer to play against. This would be my third version of a tic tac toe game I've created over the course of about four years. After each version I've learned a lot about my mistakes and tried to further challenge myself. My first version was a computer that made its decisions based of a randomly generated selection. This of course was no fun to play against but at the time I thought was pretty cool. The second was a completely brute-forced, hardcoding, piece of mess containing more if statements than I've ever written in my entire life. This was my third version. In this one, I tried to use an established algorithm to make decisions for the computer this time. It ended up working fairly nicely and gave me a good understanding of basic algorithms.

### Egg's with Legs
[Repository](https://github.com/chauphana/Eggs-with-Legs/tree/master2)

This was a really fun project. Working on a program as a group is an interesting challenge as beginners because of the differences that are going to occur when everyone is programming on their own devices. That was a large problem that we had to figure out. Eventually we actually took the time to learn and understand what Github is and what it can do to make our lives easier programming this together. When we started this project, we dove head first into Apple's Spritekit without really any understanding of what it can really do. Because of this, we didn't create the most structurally sound code to base everything off. Every time we had a new idea or concept and tried to implement it, it would break or work, but wouldn't work how we wanted because of how everything else was designed to. Even though we never finished this project, as a team we learned a lot about making games and the process of working on a "big" project as a group. 


### Eden Prairie High School App

This was my first project that wasn't a game. Because of that, this project was completely new to me. I had never touched, UI designs, databases, or made anything that cared about a user experience. So working around with this project, I learned a lot about app development process with an app that is actually going to targeted at a group of people. With that in mind, designing the app in a way that will make the experience seemless was an interesting task. 

### Tom's Adventure/Rocket Jump Game
[Repository](https://github.com/chauphana/Tom-s-Adventure)

This will be my personal project to work on. The goal here is to apply the ideas and techniques I learned from working on Tic-Tac-Toe, Eggs with Legs, and even the school app to create a game that will be challenging but fun. I hope to just use this game as another project to experiment and explore ideas on than to try to create a finish product. But maybe it will turn out better than I hope it to be. For now, it is a textureless, barebones, rectangle based playground for maybe a rocket jumping game.
