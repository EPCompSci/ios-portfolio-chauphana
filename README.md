### Egg's with Legs
[Repository](https://github.com/chauphana/Eggs-with-Legs/tree/master2)

This was a really fun project. Working on a program as a group is an interesting challenge as beginners because of the differences that are going to occur when everyone is programming on their own devices. That was a large problem that we had to figure out. Eventually we actually took the time to learn and understand what Github is and what it can do to make our lives easier programming this together. When we started this project, we dove head first into Apple's Spritekit without really any understanding of what it can really do. Because of this, we didn't create the most structurally sound code to base everything off. Every time we had a new idea or concept and tried to implement it, it would break or work, but wouldn't work how we wanted because of how everything else was designed to. Even though we never finished this project, as a team we learned a lot about making games and the process of working on a "big" project as a group. 



### Tom's Tic Tac Toe
[Repository](https://github.com/chauphana/Tom-s-Tic-Tac-Toe)

This was my first iOS project I played around with. The goal was to just mess around and see how I can program a computer to play against. This would be my third version of a tic tac toe game I've created over the course of about four years. After each version I've learned a lot about my mistakes and tried to further challenge myself. My first version was a computer that made its decisions based of a randomly generated selection. This of course was no fun to play against but at the time I thought was pretty cool. The second was a completely brute-forced, hardcoding, piece of mess containing more if statements than I've ever written in my entire life. This was my third version. In this one, I tried to use an established algorithm to make decisions for the computer this time. It ended up working fairly nicely and gave me a good understanding of basic algorithms.




Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!
